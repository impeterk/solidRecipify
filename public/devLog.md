# Recipify
###### Solid.js + Pocketbase
---

### SetUp
We are going to build simple full stack application featuring user generated content - in our case recipes. For front end we are going to use Solid.js as framework of choice. We are not going to us plain SolidJS, but rather SolidStart. For styling we are going to use tailwind. And for database we are going to use pocketbase, since it's really tiny and easy to implement and work with.

#### Solid.js
- fast and simple
- no Virtual DOM
  
#### Tailwind
- powerfull
- provides the best start for own styling

#### Pocketbase
- fast
- simple to set up
- tiny package
